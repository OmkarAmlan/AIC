Poker Baazi is Scamming,https://www.mouthshut.com/review/Pokerbaazi-com-review-umspotsttlp,"I believe that Poker Baazi may not be a trustworthy poker platform as I have experienced losing with strong hands such as AA and AK suited. I tend to play a more conservative style of poker, and even after spending many hours on the platform, I have not been successful in making a profit. While Poker Baazi used to offer great rewards, they now seem to prioritize making money over providing value to their users. I cannot speak to the experience of playing tournaments on Poker Baazi, as I am not very familiar with them, but I have played cash games and have lost over 20 lakhs, which has been disheartening. As a result, I recommend that players consider switching to other genuine apps like Spartan or Adda, where I have had better experiences and have made some money. I caution against risking your hard-earned money on platforms where you do not feel comfortable or confident in your ability to succeed."
